*
* DESCRIPTION :
*       How to use printf with uartavr
*
* NOTES :
*       This is an example for the uartavr library. This shows how to use
*       the printf function with this library. In order to do this the Makefile
*       must link to the math library and printf_min or printf_flt.
*       In order to show some useful data this example activates the internal
*       temperature sensor that some Atmel avrs have. This sensor is not very
*       accurate. You should consider a one or two point calibration and store
*       the calibration data in the EEPROM. The values used in this example worked
*       quite good with an ATmega328P.
*       Have a look at AVR122: Calibration of the AVR's Internal Temperature Reference
*
*       Be careful not to provide an external reference voltage to AREF with this
*       example as the adc is set to use an internal reference (1.1). If you do
*       this they will be shorted to the external voltage.
