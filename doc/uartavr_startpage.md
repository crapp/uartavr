# uartavr API Documentation {#mainpage}

uartavr is a simple interrupt driven UART library for Atmel AVRs. The library
consists of a header and source file. The library is documented using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html)

The latest version of the API docs can be found at [github.io](https://crapp.github.io).
If you need a local version you can use the doxygen tool to create one using the
doxygen config file in the `doc` subfolder.

## Usage

To use the library simply add the source code files to your project.

The API documentation of the file uart.h is the place where you should have a look
if you want to learn how to use this library.

There is also a subfolder called `tests` where you can find different examples.
